Enhancing Retail Recommender Systems with Word2Vec and GPT API
Conventional recommendation methodologies predominantly rely on collaborative filtering or content-based techniques. Nonetheless, these methods often initiate a process known as 'content-based filtering' as a preliminary step. The purpose of this step is to convert a sparsely populated user interaction matrix into a denser matrix, effectively mitigating data sparsity by reducing data dimensionality before deploying the recommendation algorithm. Regrettably, this procedure entails significant computational complexity.

Additionally, traditional methods struggle to effectively leverage textual information, such as product descriptions, to provide transparent explanations for the rationale behind their recommendation results. Fortunately, some advanced AI tools such as Word2Vec and GPT APIs may present viable solutions to address these challenges. 

I introduce a new collaborative recommendation system that will integrate transaction data, Word2Vec, and OpenAI’s GPT API. This integration is designed to engineer a highly customized recommender system tailored specifically for the retail sector.

Steps of Solution
To provide a comprehensive overview of our solution, we outline the following steps, which will be discussed in greater technical detail in subsequent sections of this paper:
1.	Data Processing: we select valid transactions and qualified customers and products from the dataset. The objective is to refine the dataset, ensuring its reliability for the development of a recommendation system. In addition, this process necessitates the creation of 'Repurchase Predictive Models' to serve as a filtering mechanism, utilizing predictive insights to filter the data.
2.	Creation of 'Customer-Product Transaction Matrix': This phase is instrumental in gathering user-item interaction data, which is integral to the operation of collaborative filtering algorithms.
3.	Transformation of the 'Customer-Product Transaction Matrix': We implement data transformation techniques to render the data more amenable for algorithmic processing. As a result, the transformation facilitates the conversion of data features into vectors using Word2Vec. 
4.	Customer Segmentation: Leveraging the vector features within the 'Customer-Product Transaction Matrix,' we engage in customer segmentation. This segmentation is pivotal for the subsequent creation of distinct recommendation rules for each customer segment. 
5.	Personalized Recommendations: Within each customer segment, we craft personalized recommendations based on the overall customer's past purchase behavior, tailoring product recommendations to their specific preferences and history.
6.	Application of  OpenAI GPT’s APIs: In this stage, we incorporate the GPT API and 'product description' text into the recommendation process. This integration enhances the transparency of our recommendations by providing clear explanations for the rationale behind the recommended products.
